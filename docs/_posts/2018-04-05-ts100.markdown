## The TS100 tank platform
As I wanted to build a moving vehicle that was not to complicated to control and can run somewhat independent from the ground it is driving on.
A tracked platform meets both these criteria as it only needs to be driven by two motors, one for each track, and the tracks can keep a good grip on most undergrounds.
I didn't want to do a lot of mechanical design for this project, which is why I chose to buy an assembly kit.
A search on AliExpress led me to the TS100 platform.

It's a tracked platform featuring two brushed 12V DC motors and can be ordered with varying gear transmission ratios.
The platform is usually around 70€ ±10€.
It's around 26cm (10.3in) wide, 28cm (11in) long and 9cm (3.5in) high.
It already comes with a lot of mounting points, is made of an aluminum alloy, which should make it easily drillable if I need other mounting points for hardware.

## Which version to choose
When I bought the TS100 I could select one of four options:
* 100 rpm
* 150 rpm
* 200 rpm
* 300 rpm

These are achieved by attaching different gearboxes to the same motor.
The TS100 is using the FH-37GB520 12V DC motor.
The following table lists the specification of the variants I could choose from.

|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Idle Speed [rpm]|Idle Current [A]|Load Speed [rpm]|Load Current [A]|Rated Torque [Nm]|Stall Current [A]|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|100|0.17|93|0.68|0.68|2.19|
|150|0.17|128|0.68|0.49|2.19|
|200|0.17|175|0.68|0.34|2.19|
|300|0.17|245|0.68|0.2|2.19|

As you can see, and as is expected by the mechanics behind gearboxes, the faster the output shaft spins, the lower the available torque is.
I did some rough calculations based on the motor dimensions and the pictures to decide for a version.
I'll only show them for the 150rpm version as this is the one I chose in the end.
From the pictures I assumed the driving wheel has a diameter $$d$$ of around 3.7mm (1.45in).

Calculating the velocity of the tracked platform at full speed:

$$v = 2\pi \cdot r \cdot n$$

Where $$n$$ is the rotational speed in revolutions per second and $$r$$ is the radius of the output wheel.
Which comes out to about 0.29m/s for the 150rpm version.

For calculating the force that the motor can exert on the ground is calculated by:

$$F_M = 2 \cdot r \cdot T$$

where $$T$$ is the torque at the output shaft. 
It is multiplied by two, as I have two engines.
This comes out to about 26.5N per engine, so 53N in total.
With this value and Newton's second law the maximum acceleration of the platform can be calculated.

## The assembly process
In the following picture all parts, as they were delivered, are displayed.

As you can see most things were packed in a way, that you only need to open one package to build one part of the platform.
All tools apart from a Phillips screwdriver where included.
The assembly was rather easy as the TS100 comes with a fully pictured assembly instruction.
Here are some more pictures of the build process and  [a video of one of the tracks running with a 5V supply](https://youtu.be/k675GzAA0rQ).
